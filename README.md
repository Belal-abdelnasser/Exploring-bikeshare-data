# Exploring-bikeshare-system-data
# Overview
Exploring data related to bike share systems using python for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
# Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

  - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
  - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
  - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
  - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
  - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
  - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
* The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

  - Gender
  - Birth Year

# Statistics Computed  
The purpose of this project is to analyze bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.
### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

  * most common month
  * most common day of week
  * most common hour of day
### 2 Popular stations and trip

  * most common start station
  * most common end station
  * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
### 3 Trip duration

  * total travel time
  * average travel time
### 4 User info

  * counts of each user type
  * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### The Files
To answer these questions using Python, the three city dataset files is needed

 * chicago.csv
 * new_york_city.csv
 * washington.csv
